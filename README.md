# Forest-Cover-Type-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This project uses machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to predict forest cover types based on various geographic and ecological features. The goal is to build a model that accurately classifies forest cover into predefined categories using a dataset from forested regions.
